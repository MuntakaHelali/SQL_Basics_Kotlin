# SQL Basics

This folder contains the source code for the SQL Basics codelab.

# Introduction

The SQLBasics project is a single screen app that simply instantiates a Room database. Rather than interacting with the database through Kotlin code, the user can write queries to get data, as well as insert and delete from a database via Android Studio's Database Inspector.
